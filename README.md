This is a very simple Sinatra app demonstrating some of the things you can do with the 
[Steffi](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/steffi) / [igraph](http://igraph.sourceforge.net/) library.

**Security note:** this app evals code taken directly from the user. Please do not run it on a public-facing server.
